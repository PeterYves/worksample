# Let's get started with Rails!
## I. Introduction to Rails Course
we are going to learn rails from scratch with meaningful explanations and examples.

### What is Rails?
Ruby on Rails, or Rails, is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby. Rails is a model–view–controller framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages.
Ruby on Rails is open source software, which is free to use and includes everything you need to build fantastic web-applications, and it is easy to learn for anyone with basic programming knowledge.

### Why rails?
* The Rails framework helps developers to build websites and applications easily and fastly, because it abstracts and simplifies common repetitive tasks.

* One of key principles of Ruby on Rails development is convention over configuration. This means that the programmer does not have to spend a lot of time configuring files in order to setup  a rails app, Rails comes with a set of conventions which help speed up development.

* Programming is much faster than with other frameworks and languages, because of the object-oriented nature of Ruby and the vast collection of open source code available within the Rails community.

* Ruby code is very readable and mostly self-documenting. This increases productivity, as there is less need to write out separate documentation, making it easier for other developers to pick up existing projects.

* Rails is strong on testing, and has good testing frameworks.

* rails is easy and fast to learn.
