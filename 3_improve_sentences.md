Scaffolding is a quick way to produce some major pieces of an application. For auto generating a set of models, views and controllers for a new resource in a single operation, scaffolding is used.  

Scaffolding is a technique supported by MVC frameworks in which programmers can specify how application database may be used. The framework or compiler uses it together with pre-defined code templates to generate the final code that the application can use to perform CRUD in database entries, effectively treating the templates as a "scaffold" on which to build a more powerful application.
